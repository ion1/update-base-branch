update-base-branch – Update the contents of a Git branch with a script

USAGE: update-base-branch [OPTION]... -- SCRIPT [SCRIPT_OPTION]...
       update-base-branch -w|--wrapper [OPTION]...

Options:
  -h, --help           Display this help
  -b, --branch=BRANCH  Update/create the branch BRANCH (default: base)
  -c, --checkout       Checkout the previous commit (if any) before running
                       SCRIPT
      --no-exclude     Tell Git not to respect .gitignore et al.
  -q, --quiet          Only print error messages
  -w, --wrapper        Print sh commands to run the caller within
                       update-base-branch, and exit immediately

SCRIPT will be run within the following environment:
• The working directory will be a temporary directory. With --checkout, BRANCH
  (if exists) will be checked out to it. Otherwise it will be empty.
• SCRATCH is set to another temporary directory, which will be just ignored and
  finally deleted.
• CHANGELOG is set to the path to the commit message in case you don’t want to
  use the default.
• INITIAL will be a non-empty string if BRANCH doesn’t already exist.
• The file descriptor 3 will be /dev/null with --quiet, stdout otherwise.

After SCRIPT has been successfully run, a commit will be created, changing
BRANCH to match the directory contents.

Typically SCRIPT will be an executable file such as:

  #!/bin/sh
  set -e
  cmd="$(update-base-branch --wrapper -b upstream)"
  eval "$cmd"
  
  # Add files to the present directory to populate the upstream branch.
  2>&3 wget -O "$SCRATCH/foo" http://example.net/foo
  install -D -m 755 "$SCRATCH/foo" bar/baz/foo
